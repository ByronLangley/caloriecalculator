# Calorie Calculator

This is a simple calorie calculator that estimates your daily maintenance calories based on your bodyweight, and adjusts the estimate after tracking your weight over a 2-week period.

## How It Works

- Select your unit (lb or kg).
- Enter your starting weight.
- Get an initial calorie estimate:
  - Pounds (lb) × 15
  - Kilograms (kg) × 33.07
- Track your weight across two weeks (enter average Week 1 and Week 2 weights).
- The calculator determines whether you were in a surplus or deficit and adjusts your maintenance calories:
  - If you were in a surplus → surplus calories are **subtracted**.
  - If you were in a deficit → deficit calories are **added**.
